# Fake News Prediction Model

This repository contains code for a machine learning model that predicts the authenticity of news articles using Logistic Regression.

## Overview

This project implements a predictive model using Logistic Regression to classify news articles as either fake or real. Python programming language was used for implementation, and Google Colab served as the development environment.

## Requirements

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab (for running the code)
- Libraries: NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn,nltk

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/WarunaDissanayake1234/Fake-News-Prediction-Model.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
   import nltk
   nltk.download('stopwords')
   ```

3. **Run the Code:**
   - Open the Jupyter Notebook or upload the provided notebook to Google Colab.
   - Follow the instructions within the notebook to preprocess the data, train the Logistic Regression model, and predict the authenticity of news articles.

## Files

- `fake_news_prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for the fake news prediction model.
- `data/`: Directory containing the dataset used for training and testing.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project includes news articles labeled as fake or real. The goal is to build a model that can accurately differentiate between fake and real news based on various features.
